# CS 4460 Information Visualization Final Project
## Javacadabra

### TO RUN:
1. clone repository
2. cd into the directory
3. start a local server (python -m SimpleHTTPServer)
4. open browser and go to localhost:PORT

I used bower to manage front-end dependencies, but committed the libraries/ directory anyways, just in case there are version issues.
